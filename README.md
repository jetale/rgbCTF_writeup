### Challenge description -

Name a more iconic band

I'll wait.

The flag for this challenge is all the passwords in alphabetical order, each separated by a single white-space as an MD5 hash in lower case

md5(passwordA passwordB passwordC ...)

Example: if the passwords were "dog" and "cat", the flag would be
rgbCTF{md5("cat dog")}
rgbCTF{b89526a82f7ec08c202c2345fbd6aef3}


### There is a file attached with it named `data` (which you can find in this repository)

The file is a memory dump of a Windows computer

Therefore, we decided to open it with Volatility
